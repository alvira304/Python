## Python Hangman Project
Python is a powerful multi-purpose programming language. It has simple and easy to use syntax making it perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming
for first time. It is a high-level programming language, and its core design philosophy is all about code readability and a syntax which allows programmers to express 
concepts in a few lines of code.

Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing word by guessing one letter at a time. After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the player loses. The game also ends if the player correctly identifies all the letters of the missing word.

The objective of this project is to implement the Hangman game using Python. It require random and time modules, python loops and functions.

**random module** : random module is used to randomly choose an item from a list [] or basically a sequence. here *random.choice()* method returns a random item from a list
                    tuple, or string.
                
**time module** : This module is used to import the actual time from pc to use in the program. *time.sleep()* is used to halt the execution of the program for a few seconds. 
                   It is a fun way to put the user of the game in short suspense.

In this game, there is a *list of Colors* (words) present, out of which our interpreter will choose one random color. The user first has to input their name and then, 
will be asked to guess any alphabet. If the random color contains that alphabet, it will be shown as the output(with correct placement) else the program will ask user 
to guess another alphabet. User will be given 10 turns to guess the complete color.
with this Hangman game, I have successfully developed my first python project.
